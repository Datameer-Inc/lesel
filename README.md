Lesel is a library for performing large scale semi-supervised machine learning on top of Hadoop. At the moment it contains code for
- Expectation-Maximization for mixtures of axis-aligned gaussians
- Stochastic gradient descent for the semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM)
- Label propagation with a k-nearest neighbor affinity matrix


## Documentation

See the talk [How to do Predictive Analytics with Limited Data](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/detail/30826) at Hadoop World 2013 for an introduction to the algorithms used in Lesel.
