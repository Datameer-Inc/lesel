Lesel is a library for performing large scale semi-supervised machine learning on top of Hadoop. At the moment it contains code for
- Expectation-Maximization for mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians
- Stochastic Gradient Descent for the Semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM)
- Label Propagation with a k-Nearest Neighbor affinity matrix


## Documentation

The algorithms in Lesel are explained in the talk [How to do Predictive Analytics with Limited Data](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/detail/30826) at Hadoop World 2013.
